# SimpleGoWebService
Simple web service for learning Go

Right now the service reads and writes from a simple two-table Postgress local installation. My goal is the following:

- Move to a no SQL db
- Read / Write a blob
- Continue to refactor and improve the code
- Learn GO best practices
- Create tests
